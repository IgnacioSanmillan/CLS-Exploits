#x86 Exploit Development Course in Windows by Ricardo Narvaja.
## After doing this course, I have developed the following skills:
* Use Ida Pro to do efficient Static Analysis:
	* Identification and Definition of structures
	* Understanding the Stack Layout
	* Identification of vulnerabilities without dynamic analysis
	* Symbol and Function resolution
* Dynamic Analysis Tricks:
	* Patching entry Point of application to then attach to it
		* EB FE (jmp $)
		* CC (int3)
		* Bit Patterns for debug release applications
* Stack Overflows and Heap Overflows:
	* Change functions propieties
	* Control flow of execution
* Integer Underflow / Overflow
* Write custom shellcode
	* shellcode to interact with sockets
	* shellcode to migrate to a different process
* Bypass of the following Exploit Mitigations Technologies:
	* ASLR
	* NX
	* Stack canaries
	* NoSEH
	* Different combinations of them
* Advance Return Oriented Programming
	* Multi-stage ROP Exploits
	* Virtualloc / MemProtect ROP chains
* Use after Free Vulnerabilities
	* vtable exploitation
